# Hello!

![eckert](assets/images/eckert.jpg){align=left width=280}

News 🌍 I will join the group of Rick Adams at UCL as a post-doc in January 2026! More on this soon... 

I am currently a post-doc at the Theoretical Cognitive Neuroscience Group (PI: Dominik Endres) at Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany. In my research, I apply Bayesian graphical models to cognitive and perceptual decision-making, with a special interest in mental disorders such as autism, psychosis, and depression. 

I did my Ph.D. at the Visual Perception Group (PI: Philipp Sterzer) at Charité Berlin, the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, and the Einstein Center for Neuroscience. My Ph.D. focussed on mechanisms of sensory information-processing in psychosis. I received the [Robert Koch Prize](https://www.ecn-berlin.de/news-reader/robert-koch-prize-of-charite-2024-for-dr-anna-lena-eckert.html) for my dissertation.

My research interests: 

- [Psychosis](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/49/2/397/6849479)
