My work focusses on the application of Bayesian graphical models to cognitive and perceptual decision-making. 

I "obtained" my Ph.D. from Charité Berlin and the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, where I was funded by the Einstein Center for Neuroscience - waiting for my defense since 1 year and counting! Thanks Charité Promotionsbuero! :middle_finger:
