# Hello!

![eckert](assets/images/eckert.jpg){align=left width=280}

I am currently a research fellow at UCL with Rick Adams, where I am working on computational approaches to goal planning in humans and mice, and how it might break down in psychosis. 

Previously, I was a post-doc at the Theoretical Cognitive Neuroscience Group (PI: Dominik Endres) at Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany. Here, I applied graphical models (such as Active Inference) to perception and decision-making.

I did my Ph.D. at the Visual Perception Group (PI: Philipp Sterzer) at Charité Berlin and the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, funded by the Einstein Center for Neuroscience. My Ph.D. focussed on mechanisms of sensory information-processing in psychosis. I received the [Robert Koch Prize](https://www.ecn-berlin.de/news-reader/robert-koch-prize-of-charite-2024-for-dr-anna-lena-eckert.html) for my dissertation.
