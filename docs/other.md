- I love to run :runner: My favourite distance is the half marathon, I participate in around 3-5 events each year. My latest PB is 1:36 (Milano, Italy, 2024). 

- I love to read :books: I read mostly non-fiction and classics but I'll read anything, really. 

- I am a first-generation academic :fontawesome-solid-graduation-cap: and was active in the German community [Arbeiterkind.de](https://www.arbeiterkind.de/) for a while.
